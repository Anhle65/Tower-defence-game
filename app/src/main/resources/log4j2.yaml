    # Bind Hibernate SQL loggers to dedicated SQL log file (bad practice to have in production)
    # and define print level to "TRACE". Additivity "false" means that all printed log statements won't
    # be passed to parent logger
    Logger:
      - name: org.hibernate.SQL
        level: TRACE
        additivity: false
        AppenderRef:
          ref: sqllog

      - name: org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql
        level: TRACE
        additivity: false
        AppenderRef:
          ref: sqllog

      # Send app-related log statements (i.e., every logger with names starting with "uc.seng301")
      # to both app log file and console appenders (with different log levels)
      - name: uc.seng301
        AppenderRef:
          - ref: applog
            level: INFO
          # Uncomment below logger if you want to log to the console
          # - ref: stdout
          #   level: ALL

      # Uncomment below logger if you want to log from your Cucumber classes
      # - name: gradle.cucumber
      #   AppenderRef:
      #     ref: stdout
      #     level: ALL

    # Alternatively, all declared loggers (even library ones) can be passed to the "parent" root logger
    # that will collect all log statements that are not redirected to other appenders (as both Hibernate ones above)
    # and all forwarded ones as uc.seng301 logger above that is also sent to this root logger.
    # You can also see that uc.seng301 log debug statements will be printed here while not printed in the applog file.

      level: all
